# A Gentle Introduction to Bayesian Statistics and Modeling
Code and examples for a workshop on Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming.

## Resources for learning Bayesian statistics

Richard McElreath's [course](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024) on "Statistical Rethinking"; variants of example code available in python (pymc), R, and Julia.

Andrew Gelman's book [Bayesdian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/).

Jose Storopoli's [online tutorial](https://storopoli.io/Bayesian-Julia/) using the Julia probabilistic programming language [Turing.jl](https://turinglang.org/).

Geir Evensen's book on [Data Assimilation Fundamentals](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/54434) for those interested in applying Bayesian stats to dynamical models.

If you have any further suggestions for resources to add here, please create an issue to let me know!
